<!--In this lab you'll create a table to display commonly used named character entities. Using what you've learned so far in this chapter, perform the following steps:

1. Find the data for the table at the bottom of this page. It's located in an HTML comment below the closing HTML tag. Use this data to create a simple table with 3 columns and 18 rows.

2. Examine the data to determine which cells should be table header cells.

3. Set the cellpadding and cellspacing for the table to 0. Set the border to 1.

4. Make the table more accessible by setting the scope of the table headers and giving the table a summary. The summary should reflect the purpose and content of the table.

5. Create a caption for the table. Consider whether existing page content  can be incorporated into the table.

6. In the first table cell of each row, give the table cell a class attribute of "center" to take advantage of an existing style in the CSS.
