<!--In this lab you'll build the basic page structure for our Up and Running with HTML reference site. Using what you've learned so far in this chapter, peform the following steps:

1. Add the html5 doctype
2. Add an html element, specifying that the document uses english
3. Add the document head
4. Inside the head add a meta tag that sets the character set to utf-8
5. After that, insert "Introduction to HTML" as the document's title
6. Add the body tag
7. Inside the body, add the following sections with divs, using the ID attributes specified below. Use the lines of text below these instructions as contents for each section:
	a. header
    b. content
    c. footer
    
If you get stuck, check the intro.htm file in the "finished_files" directory for help. Good luck!!-->

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
